## Welcome

Welcome to the "GPT-4 Prompts" repository! Here, you will find prompts for GPT-4 that utilize its multimodality to produce the best results.

[GPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) is a LLM developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com). One of its key features, not like [GPT-3.5/ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), is its ability to recognize images.

This repository draws inspiration from [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts). However, since that repository is outdated, I have created a new collection to share GPT-4's new capabilities with everyone.

Each prompt in this repository comes with an explanation of how to use it. You can also [contribute](https://github.com/mikavehns/gpt-4-prompts/edit/main/README.md) by adding your own prompts to this collection.

These prompts are designed to be used on the [OpenAI-Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat). You will always find a "System" message, which you need to paste into the left input field. Any additional instructions will be provided above the prompt.

```
def    sum    (a ,b )    :
  #adding two numbers

num1 =    5
num2 =    10

#calling function
result= sum (num1, num2)
print("The sum of", num1 , "and", num2 , "is", result)
```

##### Output
```
Here's the formatted code:

  def sum(a, b):
      # adding two numbers
      return a + b

  num1 = 5
  num2 = 10

  # calling function
  result = sum(num1, num2)
  print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", result)

Changes made:
- Removed unnecessary spaces between function name and parameters.
- Added spaces between parameters and commas.
- Added spaces around operators for better readability.
- Removed unnecessary parentheses around return statement.
